## Recursos

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can create and manage haircut appointments easily.

- **Email Notifications**: An email is sent to confirm the booking after scheduling. (Note: Email settings must be configured by the user. The current implementation uses a custom email-sending service set up by the developer.)

## Observação

- **Database integration**: The system currently does not support database storage. All data handling is local and non-persistent. A database integration feature is planned for future updates, enabling robust data management.

## Recursos futuros

- Integration with relational or non-relational databases to store appointment details securely.
- Enhanced user interface for better experience.
- Role-based access control for barbers and administrators.
